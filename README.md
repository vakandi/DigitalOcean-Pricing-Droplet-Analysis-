| **Storage-Optimized Droplet - Regular**  | 16 GiB  | 2        | 4,000 GiB    | 300 GiB SSD | $131/month | 800-1000                    | Well within limit (60 MB/month)             | Low (20-40%)                 | Low to Moderate (30-50%)     | Best for applications needing significant storage, not necessarily needed for a dashboard-focused application.                                   |

### Explanation
- **Max Simultaneous Users**: Estimated based on typical resource usage for web applications and handling API requests.
- **Bandwidth Usage**: Assumed JSON response size is small; 60 MB/month is very low compared to the transfer limits.
- **RAM and CPU Usage**: Estimated percentages indicate how much of the resource would be utilized at the maximum number of simultaneous users.

### Recommendations:
- **Starting Point**: 
  - **Basic Droplet - Premium AMD (2 GiB RAM, 1 vCPU)** for initial deployment. This should handle up to 200 users with good performance at $14/month.
  
- **Scaling Plan**:
  - **Upgrade to CPU-Optimized Droplet (4 GiB RAM, 2 vCPUs)** if user base grows beyond 200. This can handle up to 500 users efficiently at $42/month.
  - **Further Upgrade to General Purpose Droplet (8 GiB RAM, 2 vCPUs)** for even larger user bases, supporting up to 800 users at $63/month.

This table and the recommendations provide a clear, simple guide for choosing the appropriate DigitalOcean plan based on expected user load and resource requirements.
